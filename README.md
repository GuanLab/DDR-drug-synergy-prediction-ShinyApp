# DeepDDR

Welcome to our shiny app for DDR drug synergy and efficacy prediction
repository. This repository implements a shiny app that provides a
general overview of all features used for the predictions, the
predictions on our 62 cell lines and summary plots for SHAP analysis on
our data. Additionally, a user has the opportunity to upload molecular data and analyse
predicted synergy and efficacy scores of our model

For scoring new experimental data, the user only needs to upload the TPM expression values for 78 genes:

## Requirements

This application was tested using R 4.1.1.

## Installation

To run the app, you will need to install the devtools package.

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
```

Next you can install the app using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("GuanLab/DDR-drug-synergy-prediction-ShinyApp")
```

After a restart of your R session, you can start the app using:

``` r
library(guanlabddrdrugcombination)

launch_synergy_ddr_app()
```
